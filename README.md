# Meal_Tracking_Application

I completed a tutorial to learn the basics of developping iOS applications, and the Swift programming language. The code in this repository was implemented following the "Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)" tutorial on Apple's developper platform. Documentation for the tutorial can be found at https://developer.apple.com (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343). It uses Xcode 8.1 (Swift 3) and the code in this repository was implemented using Xcode 9.4.1 (Swift 4.1).

FoodTracker is a simple meal-tracking application. It displays a list of meals (name, rating, and photo). Meals can be added/edited by navigating to another screen, and meals can be removed from the list. NSCoding was used to store/retrieve changes to/from disk between different runs of the application.
