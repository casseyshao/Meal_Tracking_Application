# Meal_Tracking_Application

The code in this repository was implemented following the "Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)" tutorial on Apple's developper platform. This code is *not* original. Documentation for the tutorial can be found at https://developer.apple.com. It uses Xcode 8.1 (Swift 3) and the code in this repository was implemented using Xcode 9.4.1 (Swift 4.1). I completed the tutorial to learn the basics of developping iOS applications, and the Swift programming language.

FoodTracker is a simple meal-tracking application. It displays a list of meals (name, rating, and photo). Meals can be added/edited by navigating to another screen, and meals can be removed from the list. NSCoding was used to store/retrieve changes to/from disk between different runs of the application.
